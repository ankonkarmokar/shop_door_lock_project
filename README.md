# Shop_Door_Lock_Project

## Overview

This project is a simple door lock system designed for a shop, utilizing an ultrasonic sensor and Arduino Uno. The system detects the proximity of an individual using the ultrasonic sensor and controls a servo motor to lock or unlock the door. This README provides detailed information on the project components, setup, and usage.

### Platform Setup
- Proteus 8 Professional
- Arduino IDE 2.2.1

## Components

1. **Arduino Uno**: The main microcontroller that processes sensor data and controls the locking mechanism.
2. **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**: Detects the distance of an object in front of it.
3. **Servo Motor**: Controls the door lock mechanism.
4. **Jumper Wires**: For connecting components on the breadboard.
5. **Breadboard**: Provides a platform for prototyping and connecting electronic components.
6. **Power Supply**: Supplies power to the Arduino and servo motor.
7. **LCD (16x2 or other configuration)**: The main display unit.
